# Summary

Proteins are complex biomolecules which fulfill important and diverse tasks in
living organisms. Studying and understanding their structure, function, and
dynamics is essential for life sciences and can be applied for, e.g., disease
control or advanced drug design. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational
method relying on physical models to simulate biomolecular systems. The
movements of all atoms can be 'viewed' like a movie and analyzed to improve the
understanding of specific interactions or complement experimental measurements.
Replica Exchange (REX) [@sugita1999replica; @zhang2005convergence] is a powerful
method used to enhance the sampling of protein conformations and generates large
amounts of data.

`pyrexMD` is designed as an interactive 'all-purpose' toolkit for
research projects which rely on (contact-guided) Replica Exchange Molecular
Dynamics using `GROMACS` [@van2005gromacs]. Due to its workflow-orientated
design, it is possible to rapidly create whole setup or analysis workflows,
thereby significantly enhancing productivity and reducing the time spent at
various stages of the project.


# Statement of need

Timescales of various biomolecular interactions of interest, such as protein
folding, conformation transitions, or ligand binding, are typically in the order
of µs to s. MD simulations, however, operate in 1-2 fs steps, which makes
in-silico studies of proteins computationally demanding. Besides, observations
of native configurations during MD simulations are often not guaranteed and
proteins can become trapped in certain conformations. One possibility to
overcome this problem is utilizing an enhanced sampling technique such as REX.
Depending on the research goal, it is also possible to integrate an additional
theoretically [@morcos2011direct] or experimentally derived [@perilla2017cryoem]
bias into MD simulations to restrict the search space and thus effectively lower
computational costs.

Research studies relying on REX, however, can become very arduous and time
consuming. REX simulations usually not only require knowledge of various program
tools but also consist of many individual steps ranging from simulation setup
and pre-processing over testing and simulation-monitoring to post-processing and
data analyses. Furthermore, REX generates large amounts of data and requires in
particular a systematic handling of I/O.

`pyrexMD` is designed as an interactive 'all-purpose' toolkit specifically for
(contact-guided) REX projects using `GROMACS` and is intended to be used in
jupyter notebooks. It efficiently integrates the following popular MD-related
python packages:

- `MDAnalysis` [@oliver_beckstein-proc-scipy-2016; @michaud2011mdanalysis],

- `nglview` [@nguyen2018nglview],

- `GromacsWrapper` [@oliver_beckstein_2019_2654393].

By covering all important aspects with its functionality, `pyrexMD` eliminates the
need of switching to additional programs which unnecessarily interrupts the
workflow and often requires know-how of different command line syntaxes.
Furthermore, `pyrexMD` offers many workflow-orientated functions and templates for
different stages of a REX study. Its main focuses are 1) providing efficient and
robust methods for setting up optimized (contact-guided) REX simulations and 2)
offering many different structure analysis functions to exploit the large I/O
sets generated by REX. It also adds a variety of useful general functions and
QoL improvements, such as interactive links between a figure and trajectory or
creation of multi-panel figures from .pickle files. With `pyrexMD`, it becomes
especially easy to share and reproduce research results or transfer the work on
other target structures of interest. Furthermore, it lowers the technical
boundaries for newcomers who want to do research using REX enhanced sampling.

# Applications

`pyrexMD` was initially developed during the work of [@voronin2020including]. It
is currently applied in two ongoing REX studies about protein and RNA structure
refinement. Fig. 1 exemplarily shows an analysis of used bias contacts with
regards to the true positive rate. Fig. 2 shows the local accuracy based on a
global distance test for models generated during a REX study.

The figure shows the TPR of considered bias contacts in blue, a TPR-cutoff of 75% in
red, a region of interested shaded in orange and an estimated ideal number of
contacts based on selection rules from
